      "content": "Last night I bought a hard drive for 300.00 pesos. I thought the deal\nwas too good so I made a conversation with the seller. Turns out it \nwas defective. Now, he made arrangements again that he would replace\nthe defective hard drive, but again, it's still defective. I am now \nstill waiting for his reply to replace me for a working one. I really\nhope that it'll go well this time. \n\nMy partner lent her money to me so that I could buy a new one. \nI just feel sad that the one I bought is defective. \nIf anything goes bad, I'll go to a physical store tomorrow and buy\na really legit one. \n\nWill update!! :(",
